## Introduction
The purpose of this assignment is to develop a linear model that can "reliably" predict a team's number of wins (TARGET_WINS), based on a number of variables ranging from BATTING, BASERUN(ning), FIELDING, and PITCHING. Some of the variables have a positive impact on TARGET_WINS, while others have a negative impact

## Data Exploration
```{r}
glimpse(trainingdata)
```
Using glimpse, we can see that there are `r nrow(trainingdata)` observations and `r ncol(trainingdata)` variables in our training dataset. Of the `r ncol(trainingdata)` variables, it seems INDEX provides no additional value other than being a sorting/labelling mechanism for each observation. INDEX will be removed in the *Data Preparation* section. Another thing of note is that there is no variable for singles. The variable TEAM_BATTING_1B will also be created in the *Data Preparation* section

### Non-Visual Inspection

#### Variables Breakdown
  + Response Variable: TARGET_WINS
  + Explanatory Variables:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_frame(variables = names(trainingdata)) %>%
  mutate(variables = str_replace(variables, "^([[:alnum:]]+?_{1})([[:alnum:]]+?)(_{1}[[:alnum:]]+?)$", "\\2")) %>%
  group_by(variables) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(count))
```
    - 7 Batting variables
    - 4 Pitching variables
    - 2 Baserunning variables
    - 2 Fielding variables

#### Basic Stats
```{r basicstats, echo=FALSE}
trainingStats <- basicStats(trainingdata)[c("nobs", "NAs", "Minimum", "Maximum", "1. Quartile", "3. Quartile", "Mean", "Median", "Variance", "Stdev", "Skewness", "Kurtosis"),] %>%
  as.tibble() %>%
  rownames_to_column() %>%
  gather(var, value, -rowname) %>%
  spread(rowname, value) %>%
  rename_all(str_to_lower) %>%
  rename_all(str_trim) %>%
  rename(variables = "var",
         "q1" = `1. quartile`,
         "q3" = `3. quartile`,
         "max"= maximum,
         "min" = minimum,
         "na_vals" = nas, 
         "n" = nobs,
         "sd" = stdev,
         "var" = variance) %>%
  mutate(obs = n - na_vals,
         range = max - min,
         iqr = q3 - q1) %>%
  select(variables, n, na_vals, obs, mean, min, q1, median, q3, max, sd, var, range, iqr, skewness, kurtosis) %>%
  as.tibble()

trainingStats
```
  * basicStats is able to show that TEAM_BATTING_HBP has the most egregious amount of missing values
  * There is very strong skew in the TEAM_PITCHING_SO variable
  * TEAM_PITCHING_H has the highest variance amongst the variables


#### Missing Values
```{r, echo=FALSE}
trainingStats %>%
  dplyr::filter(na_vals > 0) %>%
  select(variables, na_vals, obs) %>%
  arrange(desc(na_vals))
```
The 6 fields shown in the table above having missing values.

#### Skew
```{r, echo=FALSE}
trainingStats %>%
  mutate(mean = mean(skewness)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(skewness > mean(skewness)) %>%
  select(variables, skewness, mean)
```
The 4 fields shown in the table above have higher than average skew values, which provides evidence of outliers greatly effecting the mean of those fields

#### Correlation
```{r}
trainingdata %>%
  mutate(TEAM_BATTING_1B = TEAM_BATTING_H - TEAM_BATTING_2B - TEAM_BATTING_3B - TEAM_BATTING_HR) %>%
  cor(use = "na.or.complete") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "predictor") %>%
  as_data_frame() %>%
  select(predictor, TARGET_WINS) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!predictor %in% c("INDEX", "TARGET_WINS")) %>%
  arrange(desc(TARGET_WINS))
```
  * The correlations tell us that HITS have the highest impact on winning games
  * There is some collinearity between some of the variables, especially the BATTING variables
  * FIELDING_E has the greatest impact on losing games
  * TEAM_BATTING_3B has an anomolous negative correlation on TARGET_WINS

### Visual Inspection

#### Density Plots
```{r, echo=FALSE}
# data frame for visuals
vis <- melt(trainingdata) %>%
  dplyr::filter(variable != "INDEX") %>%
  mutate(variable = str_replace(variable, "TEAM_", ""))

ggplot(vis, aes(value)) +
  geom_density(fill = "skyblue") +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free")
```
  * The density plots show various issues with skew an non-normality

#### Box Plots

Box plots can provide a visual representation of the variance of the data
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(vis, aes(x = variable, y = value)) +
  geom_boxplot(show.legend = T) +
  stat_summary(fun.y = mean, color = "red", geom = "point", shape = 18, size = 3) +
  coord_flip() +
  ylim(0, 2200)
```
  * The box plots reveal that a great majority of the explanatory variables have high variances
  * Some of the variables contain extreme outliers that this graph does not show because i had to reduce the limits on the graph to get clear box plots
  * Many of the medians and means are also not aligned which demonstrates the outliers' effects 

#### Histograms
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(vis, aes(value)) +
  geom_histogram()  +
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free")
```
  * The histograms reveal that very few of the variables are normally distributed
  * A few variables are multi-modal
  * Some of the variable exhibit a lot of skew (e.g. BASERUN_SB)

## Data Preparation

### New Variable for Singles
```{r, echo=FALSE}
remove_string <- function(x, remove) {
  str_replace(x, remove, "")
}

training <- trainingdata %>%
  # singles
  mutate(TEAM_BATTING_1B = TEAM_BATTING_H - TEAM_BATTING_2B - TEAM_BATTING_3B - TEAM_BATTING_HR) %>%
  # remove 'TEAM_'
  rename_all(remove_string, remove = "TEAM_")
```
  * The variable TEAM_BATTING_1B was created and added to the dataset

#### Variable Removal
```{r}
training %<>%
  # remove fields with large amount of NAs
  select(-c("BATTING_HBP", "BASERUN_CS")) %>%
  # remove all hits to reduce collinearity
  select(-BATTING_H) %>%
  # remove INDEX
  select(-INDEX)
```
  * Our dataset will be augmented by removing the fields with a large amount of NA values (BATTING_HBP, BASERUN_CS)
  * BATTING_H will be removed to reduce collinearity and replaced by BATTING_1B which is a calculated variable based on BATTING_H, BATTING_2B, BATTING_3B, BATTING_HR
  * INDEX is removed because it has no meaning in the dataset

#### Missing Values Handling
missForest will be used to handle all missing data by using a random forest algorithm to replace the missing values with "forest" values
```{r, echo=FALSE}
training.forest <- training %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  missForest()

training.imp <- training.forest$ximp
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# imputed values
summary(training.imp)

# imputation error
training.forest$OOBerror
```
  * Through the summary() function, we can see that none of the fields have missing values any longer

## Build Models

### Model 1: All Variables
```{r, echo=FALSE}
m1 <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ ., data = training.imp)
summary(m1)
```
  * Model 1 has 9/13 statistically significant variables at the 5% significance level
  * Interestingly, FIELDING_DP has a negative impact on wins. This may be because it would mean the opposing team is getting hits
  * The rest of the variables align as one would expect to win contribution
    + BATTING_SO, PITCHING_BB, FIELDING_E have negative impacts on TARGET_WINS as expected
    + PITCHING_HR suprisingly has a positive impact on TARGET_WINS. It is possible there is a confounding variable affecting this coefficient
    + BATTING_HR has the highest impact on wins as one would expect
  * This model also shows that giving up home-runs is not as big a detriment as one may think
  * An R^2 of .3512 indicates that there may be room to improve the model

### Model 2: Only Significant Variables
```{r, echo=FALSE}
m2 <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ . - BATTING_BB - PITCHING_H - PITCHING_HR - PITCHING_BB - PITCHING_SO, data = training.imp)
summary(m2)
```
  * Model 2 removes the non-significant variables
  * The R^2 is lower than Model 1 at .3459 however this may be acceptable due to removing the confounding variables
  * FIELDING_DP still has a negative impact on wins
  * The rest of the variables align as one would expect to win contribution
    + BATTING_SO, FIELDING_E have negative impacts on TARGET_WINS as expected
    + BATTING_HR has the highest impact on wins as one would expect
  
### Model 3: Highly Correlated Variables
```{r}
trainingdata %>%
  mutate(TEAM_BATTING_1B = TEAM_BATTING_H - TEAM_BATTING_2B - TEAM_BATTING_3B - TEAM_BATTING_HR) %>%
  cor(use = "na.or.complete") %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "predictor") %>%
  as_data_frame() %>%
  select(predictor, TARGET_WINS) %>%
  dplyr::filter(!predictor %in% c("INDEX", "TARGET_WINS")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(TARGET_WINS > mean(TARGET_WINS)) %>%
  arrange(desc(TARGET_WINS)) 

m3 <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ PITCHING_H + BATTING_BB + PITCHING_BB + PITCHING_HR + BATTING_HR + BATTING_2B + BATTING_1B, data = training.imp)
summary(m3)
```
  * Of the three models, Model 3 has the lowest R^2 at .232
  * Model 3 also reintroduces variables that are not statistically significant
  * BATTING_3B is not introduced into this model as it did have a negative correlation
  * PITCHING_H is the only variable that has a negative impact on TARGET_WINS
  * The rest of the variables align as one would expect to win contribution
    + BATTING_HR has the highest impact on wins as one would expect
    + BATTING_1B has the second highest impact on wins, a lot more than BATTING_2B which is unexpected
    + PITCHING_HR has a very small positive impact on wins. This is counterintuitive as giving up runs should increase the chance of losing (decrease the chance of winning)

### Model 4: Log Transformation of All Variables
```{r}
remove_negInf <- function(x) {
  if_else(x < 0, 0, x)
}

log.training.imp <- training.imp %>%
  # log transform
  mutate_all(funs(log(.))) %>%
  # replace -Inf with 0
  mutate_all(funs(remove_negInf(.)))

m4 <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ ., data = log.training.imp)
summary(m4)
```
  * Model 4 has the highest R^2 at .4385
  * Negative impact on wins
    + BATTING_BB, BATTING_SO, PITCHING_H, FIELDING_E, FIELDING_DP
    + The anomolies are BATTING_BB and FIELDING_DP which one would expect a positive coefficient
  * Positive impact on wins
    + BATTING_1B has the highest impact on TARGET_WINS
    + PITCHING_BB has an anomolously high impact on TARGET_WINS. Giving up bases should have a negative impact on wins. It is impossible this is done to hitters that are particularly dangerous when being pitched straight up to
  * The homerun variables are not statistically significant

### Model 5: Square Root Transform
```{r}
sq.training.imp <- training.imp %>%
  # sqrt transform
  mutate_all(funs(sqrt(.)))

m5 <- lm(TARGET_WINS ~ ., data = sq.training.imp)
summary(m5)
```
  * Model 5 has an R^2 at .387
  * Negative impact on wins
    + BATTING_BB, BATTING_SO, PITCHING_H, FIELDING_E, FIELDING_DP
    + The anomolies are BATTING_BB and FIELDING_DP which one would expect a positive coefficient
  * Positive impact on wins
    + BATTING_1B has the highest impact on TARGET_WINS
  * PITCHING_HR, PITCHING_BB, and BATTING_BB are not statistically significant

## Select Models
Based on the R^2, Model 4 is the ideal model to use and the best predictor for TARGET_WINS. Its R^2 was .4385. Model 3's R^2 was simply far too low and reintroduced statistically insignificant variables. Model 1 provides a great benchmark for R^2 that Model 2 comes close to achieving. Model 5 was only able to achieve a .387 R^2.

### Evaluation
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))

plot(m4)
hist(m4$residuals)
qqnorm(m4$residuals)
qqline(m4$residuals)
```
 * The QQ plot shows slight deviation from normal towards the extremities however this can be excused due to the sheer amount of observations
 * The residual plot indicates that there is no constant variance
 * The histogram shows a normal distribution amongst the residuals
 
### Test Model
```{r}
summary(testdata)
```
  * INDEX can be removed from the data
  * The NA values will be handled with missForest similar to our training set
  * BATTING_1B will be added and BATTING_H removed
  * TEAM_BATTING_HBP, TEAM_BASERUN_CS will be removed

#### Transform Test Data
```{r}
testdata %<>%
  # drop useless variables
  select(-c("INDEX", "TEAM_BATTING_HBP", "TEAM_BASERUN_CS")) %>%
  # add BATTING_1B
  mutate(TEAM_BATTING_1B = TEAM_BATTING_H - TEAM_BATTING_2B - TEAM_BATTING_3B - TEAM_BATTING_HR) %>%
  # remove 'TEAM_'
  rename_all(remove_string, remove = "TEAM_")
```

```{r}
test.forest <- testdata %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  missForest()

test.imp <- test.forest$ximp
```
#### Predict
```{r}
test_results <- predict(m4, newdata = test.imp)

bind_cols(data.frame(TARGET_WINS = test_results), test.imp)
```
